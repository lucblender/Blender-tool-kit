Blender-tool-kit
================

I've worked a lot with blender and every time I was like : Why on earth this option isn't implemented??

There is a lot of tools on this tool-kit:

        Possibility to enable or disable the animation to play
        Change the format file of all scenes with some preset
        Change the render path of all scene and possibility to add or remove keyword from the path
        Add new scene (full copy) with material correction (no material duplication)
        Replace double material ex: Material , Material.001 -> become both Material
        Change all font for the selected one
        Show the active object material and all his users with some details
        Possibility to render all scenes or selected scenes
        Other useful shortcut already implemented in blender

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to help me to improve this addon or if you found a but.
